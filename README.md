# Melanoma-Detection-Project

* `Project Description:` This project uses the Melanoma Detection dataset to classify skin lesion images as benign or malignant.  
* ` Notebook Description:` The notebook uses the pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries for data processing, and PyTorch for training deep learning models. The notebook begins by extracting and loading the data, and then performs exploratory data analysis to visualize the imbalance in the dataset and the distribution of certain features. Then proceeds to train several machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks. 
* `Evaluation Metric:` ROC-AUC score.
* `Analysis:` Compared different types of models for Melanoma detection, including Logistic Regression, SVM, a custom CNN-based architecture, and EfficientNet-B2. Determined that oversampling was a better method to tackle imbalance than undersampling.
